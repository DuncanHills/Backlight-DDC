# Backlight DDC

### be warned this software is quite buggy on some hardware combinations
Not every manufacturer has made DDC-CI functionality as described in the standarts.. this causes some monitors to flikker when changing settings or even crash.
Your mac might crash (I only experienced this with macbooks due to the internal monitor not supporting DDC-CI I assume)

This application implements some (altered) functions from: https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl

This application can change brightness and contrast on your DDC-CI enabled monitor.

### support for multiple monitors


TODO:
- volume slider/mute
- sleep
- many other things
